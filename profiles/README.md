These files are **genre lenses**. They never overwrite a good title.
They only influence:
- how BPM is normalized (e.g. half/double tempo)
- what confidence is required to add a key
- which TYPE is preferred when the title is missing it
- optional default character words (used only when character is missing)

Keep titles human. Keep rules deterministic.
